# SortingAlgorithmExperiment_Python

## Background

With the same goal as my other repository ['CIS3501_SortingAlgorithm_Implementation-StatistcalAnalysis'](https://github.com/nicobokhari13/CIS3501_SortingAlgorithm_Implementation-StatistcalAnalysis), I coded the same Time Complexity experiment in Python in order to further understand how to apply Python in different coding problems.
